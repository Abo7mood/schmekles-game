## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

Schmekles Game started as a **solo project**, where I wanted to create a **high-speed competitive experience** that rewards skill and efficiency. The idea was to integrate **NFT-based verification** into a **speed-running format**, allowing players to prove their best times and compete on a leaderboard.

Designing the **challenging levels** required a balance between **difficulty and fairness**, ensuring that the fastest players could showcase their skills without unfair advantages. Implementing **precise movement mechanics** was crucial to maintaining an authentic speed-running experience.

This project pushed my development skills, especially in **leaderboard tracking and NFT integration**, making it one of my most unique solo works. The journey of building **Schmekles Game** has been an exciting dive into competitive game design! 🏆
